                <h1>Tazarin's Mind</h1>
                <p>
                    "Do you believe the stories whispered around the campfire? The ones that claw at your mind, daring you to look over your shoulder?" --
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Tazarin's hold on your mind strengthens, turning your very consciousness into a prison of his design, you discover a weakness—a sliver of hope. As you begin to fight for control over your own mind, you find yourself in an ever-shifting maze, shrouded in choking blue fog that obscures your path and clouds your senses. But there is a way to escape. Somewhere within the labyrinth lies a relic locked away in a chest. Claim it, and you might find the exit. But beware—you're not alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -- "Whether you believe those old stories or not, one truth remains: if you don’t watch your back, something else will."

                <p>
                    VooDoo Village is a turn-based strategy game utilizing an everchanging stock market. Your objective is to help VooDoo develop the economy for a town that he plans to develop on the island that you have arrived on. While shops must be created in order to sell goods, taking the time to build a shop isn't always the best strategy to maximize profits. In VooDoo Village you must compete for resources while in a race to make the most out of the island and come out on top.
